## Basics of using git

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that is very popular

The core steps to using git involves 

1. Initiate a git repository
  In RStudio we just click a little radio button on project creation 
  At the command line we type:
  `git init`
  
2. Do your normal work
  Add files, modify files, ect.
  
3. Add your important files to the "stage"
  In RStudio we click the "stage" button 
  `git add yourfilesname`
  
4. Commit your staged files to the repository
  In RStudio you just hit the "Commit" button and add a message
  `git commit -m "your message"`
  
5. Git Push to sync changes to GitHub
  The Up arrow in RStudio
  `git push`
  
6. Git Pull to sync FROM GitHub
  The Down arrow in RStudio
  `git pull`
  
You can check your project "history" and status
  `git status`
  `git log` (push Q to exit)
